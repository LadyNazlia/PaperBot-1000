# PaperBot-1000
This project was started during the Quarenteam Hackathon October 2021.

Project Title: PaperBot 1000
Team Name: LadyNazlia Alone (I think this is the name I signed up with. It is a solo project.)
Domain: Education

Note: I am super new to programming and it is possible that by the end of the hackathon that this project will not even function in the way that I plan for it to fuction,
but here is a brief explanation of what it will do when I familiarize myself with JS.

Description: This project is designed for students in an English class. The program is a special chat bot that helps students to brainstorm their English paper assignments so that they can choose
paper types, topics, and the hope is that students will be able to "chat" about their paper until they have a plan/paper outline that they can work off of as the proceed to write
their English paper. This is particularly designed for students who have trouble thinking through the paper writing process. The chatbot will ask questions that promopt the user to think
through their paper and the writing process step by step so that they can have a better understanding of what they need to do before they begin the actual writing process.
